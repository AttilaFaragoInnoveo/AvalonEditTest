# AvalonEditTest
avalon edit seems to have some scrolling issues with long softwrapped text pasting.
To reproduce the bug:
Load project
Run
copy text from AvEditTest/TextFile1.txt to your clipboard
Paste it into the form text editor
Result: Scrollbar is NOT at the bottom and cursor (caret) is not visible.
